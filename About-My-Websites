About Digital Aksumite
Our Story
Digital Aksumite was founded on the visionary ideas of Biniam Shimeles, who sought to revolutionize Ethiopia’s technological landscape. This vision was later shared with co-founder Solomon Eshetu, and in 2017 EC (2024 GC), the PLC was officially established. Soon after, Cherinet Afewerk and Misganaw Eshetu joined the team. Together, they created a dynamic and collaborative company driven by young, curious developers and managers who are passionate about making Ethiopia a hub of innovation and progress.
